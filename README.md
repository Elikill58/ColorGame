# ColorGame

Welcome on the main page of the ColorGame !
It's a minecraft mini-games, developed by Elikill58 with the help of RedNesto.

## Installation

1) Buy and download

You have to buy the plugin on Spigot (link soon). Then, it will be available for download.

2) Add to your server

Put the jar file on the "plugins" folder.

3) Restart your server

**WARN: The world 'world' will be RESET ! So, save it before restarting the server !**

Also, the **"reload" command is disabled**, because of map reset.

Some config files will be generated.

4) Done

You have to connect, then you can play on the default map !

If you want to use your own map:
- Stop the server
- Copy your map on the folder "/world_base"
- Start your server

## How it works ?

(I'm talking by default)

There is 2 teams:

Red and Blue. Both want to color all quartz block on the map, but who will be the faster colorater ?

You color when you see a quartz block, but you can change for the block below the player.

You can only color when you have a block of your team near.

## How to configure ?
